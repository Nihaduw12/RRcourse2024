## Money Heist

Money Heist (Spanish: La casa de papel, \[la ˈkasa ðe paˈpel\], lit. 'The House of Paper') is a Spanish heist crime drama television series created by Álex Pina. The series traces two long-prepared heists led by the Professor (Álvaro Morte), one on the Royal Mint of Spain, and one on the Bank of Spain, told from the perspective of one of the robbers, Tokyo (Úrsula Corberó). The story is told in a real-time-like fashion and relies on an unreliable narrator, flashbacks, time-jumps and hidden character motivations for complexity.\[2\]\[3\]\[4\]
