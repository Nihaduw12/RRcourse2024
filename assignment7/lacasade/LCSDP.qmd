```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# Data for the viewership over time
viewership <- data.frame(
  Season = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
  Viewers_in_millions = c(4.3, 3.8, 7.1, 6.7, 6.1)
)

# Plot
ggplot(viewership, aes(x = Season, y = Viewers_in_millions)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "La Casa de Papel Viewership Over Time",
       x = "Season",
       y = "Average Viewership (millions)") +
  theme_minimal()

```

As we can see ratings were low in the initial two episodes which the team began to heist in **Royal Mint of Spain** and increased in next episodes when they contuniued their heist in **Central Bank of Spain**

### Seaaonal changes in viewerships

I use the same data above.

```{r}
#| echo: false
viewership$Change <- c(NA, diff(viewership$Viewers_in_millions))
ggplot(viewership, aes(x = factor(Season), y = Change, fill = Change > 0)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Change in Viewership Between Seasons",
       x = "Season",
       y = "Change in Viewership (millions)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("red", "green"))
```

The viewership for ***La Casa de Papel*** showed a significant increase from season 2 to season 3, rising by `r round(viewership$Change[3], 1)` million viewers. undefinedHowever, a decline is observed in the subsequent seasons, with a drop of `r round(viewership$Change[5], 1)` million viewers between seasons 4 and 5.\
