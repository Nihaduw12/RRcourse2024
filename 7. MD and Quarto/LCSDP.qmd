| Season | Release Date      | Views in millions |
|:-------|:------------------|------------------:|
| 1      | May 2, 2017       |               4.3 |
| 2      | October 16, 2017  |               3.8 |
| 3      | July 19, 2019     |               7.1 |
| 4      | April 3, 2020     |               6.7 |
| 5      | September 3, 2021 |               6.1 |

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# Data for the viewership over time
viewership <- data.frame(
  Season = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
  Viewers_in_millions = c(4.3, 3.8, 7.1, 6.7, 6.1)
)

# Plot
ggplot(viewership, aes(x = Season, y = Viewers_in_millions)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "La Casa de Papel Viewership Over Time",
       x = "Season",
       y = "Average Viewership (millions)") +
  theme_minimal()

```

As we can see ratings were low in the initial two episodes which the team began to heist in **Royal Mint of Spain** and increased in next episodes when they contuniued their heist in **Central Bank of Spain**

### Seaaonal changes in viewerships

I use the same data above.

```{r}
#| echo: false
viewership$Change <- c(NA, diff(viewership$Viewers))

ggplot(viewership, aes(x = Season, y = Change)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Change in Seasons",
       x = "Season",
       y = "Change in Viewers in millions") +
  theme_minimal()


```

As we can see main views happened in the **third** season.\
